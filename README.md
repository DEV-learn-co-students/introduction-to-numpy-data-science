# What is Numpy?

## Introduction

In this lesson, we are going to introduce the Python library, *NumPy*. Why? Besides being ubiquitous to data science, NumPy also provides us with blistering fast and efficient list-like data types called N-Dimensional Arrays or **ndarray**s or more simply arrays. This list-like data type is effectively a lighter weight version of a Python **list**, as it uses less of your computer's memory, which makes it more efficient when you are dealing with large datasets. Don't worry if that seems a little vague. We will take a closer look at NumPy and how its arrays work in this lesson.

## Objectives
* How to get started with NumPy
* What is the difference between a NumPy Array and a Python List
* Understand how and when to use a NumPy Array
